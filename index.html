    <p>As this is my first website (as well as programming experience of any sorts), it seems only right that I dedicate it to my dogs. </p>

    Lottie was my first dog, a sweet Terrier Cross from <a href="https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/"> Dog's Trust</a>. <br>
    Pixie was my second dog, a Chihuahua x Terrier, from <a href="https://www.happyendingsrescue.org/"> Happy Endings Rescue</a>.
    <p>Initially Lottie was not a fan of Pixie, a bit of a bouncy goofball compared to Lotties' more relaxed persona. Luckily, Pixie brought out the puppy in Lottie and then proceeded to lose every single rough & tumble playtime.</p>

    <p>These two delightful creatures are the best friends I have had in life so it's always nice to be able to share their lovely little faces to the world.</p>
    Some personal benefits of having these little beasties
     <ul>
            <li>They cuddle well in bed</li>
            <li>They give me something to post on social media</li>
            <li>They gave eachother a wonderful friendship</li>
        </ul>
